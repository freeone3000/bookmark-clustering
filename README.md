## Inspiration
Based off of [Gabriella's work on browsing code by meaning](https://haskellforall.com/2026/02/browse-code-by-meaning),
this attempts to cluster firefox bookmarks by determining site content. LLMs are used for classification and summarization,
with spectral clustering being used to categorize.
